// Guess what answers you would get if you ran this in the

// check them by copying them and running it in the console yourself line by line 


//Evaluate the below:
5 + "34"
// Will give me 534 because js transforms number into text

5 - "4"
// Will give me 1, js transforms text into number

10 % 5
// Will give me 0, because we cant mod larger%smaller

5 % 10
// Will give me 5, because the remainder would be -> 5*1 +5

"Java" + "Script"
// No space in between, so both strings will be concatenated into "JavaScript"


" " + " "
// produces 2 spaces


" " + 0
// Space then 0

true + true
// Since true is the same as "1" the answer will be 2

true + false
// Answer is 1

false + true
// Since false is the same as "0" the answer will be 0

false - true
// -1

3 - 4
// -1

"Bob" - "bill"
// Error


//Evaluate the below comparisons:
5 >= 1
// true 

0 === 1
// Three equal signs used to test true/false, so it would be false here

4 <= 1
// false

1 != 1
// false

"A" > "B"
// Basically the sign wants to eat the NEXT alphabet, so here its false

"B" < "C"
// true

"a" > "A"
// In this case, sign wants to eat the lowercase, which yields a true value

"b" < "A"
// False

true === false
// false


true != true
// false

3 === 3
// You are basically ASKING, does 3 = 3? You will output 3

3 !== 3
// You are asking, does 3 not equal to 3? Output will be false



// Make the string: "Hi There! It's "sunny" out" by using the + sign:

"Hi There!"+" It's \"sunny\" out"
// When there are quotations inside a string, use the backslash to 
// Identify them as just quotations
